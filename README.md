# 50 Rust Projects

Inspired by [this article](http://vihart.com/fifty-fizzbuzzes/).

I have been wanting to learn Rust for a long time, and I feel like this would be a good
way to force myself into learning it.

Since I am just getting into Rust, these projects might not be as optimal or as clean as they could
be, but that is fine! This is a learning experience.
